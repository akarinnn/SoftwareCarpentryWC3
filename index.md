# A Mysterious Website
## Welcome, dear guests

This is an mysterious empty website. 
You don't know what was in here, and you will never be able to know what will be in here. 
I sincerely apologize for the five seconds you wasted on reading these lines.

However, there are still something you can play around here.
1. An [introduction](https://github.com/akarinnn/SoftwareCarpentryWC3/blob/master/README.md) about the website.
2. Say [hello](https://github.com/akarinnn/SoftwareCarpentryWC3/blob/master/hello.py) to the new world.
3. And see some [math](https://github.com/akarinnn/SoftwareCarpentryWC3/blob/master/mundaneMath.py) trick.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/akarinnn/WC3/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/akarinnn/WC3/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
