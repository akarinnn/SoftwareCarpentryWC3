# A Mysterious Website
## Welcome, dear guests

This is an mysterious empty website. 
You don't know what was in here, and you will never be able to know what will be in here. 
I sincerely apologize for the five seconds you wasted on reading these lines.

However, there are still something you can play around here.
1. An [introduction](https://github.com/akarinnn/SoftwareCarpentryWC3/blob/master/README.md) about the website.
2. Say [hello](https://github.com/akarinnn/SoftwareCarpentryWC3/blob/master/hello.py) to the new world.
3. And see some [math](https://github.com/akarinnn/SoftwareCarpentryWC3/blob/master/mundaneMath.py) trick.
